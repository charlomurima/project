        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <div class="paragraphb">
        Our mission is to support women to achieve their full 
        potential; to encourage, enable and facilitate their active 
        involvement in business, employment, learning and 
        community life. We seek to achieve this by harnessing the 
        economic power of women and communities, promoting 
        social inclusion,changing perceptions and influencing 
        policy.

        We're proud to deliver a broad range of services to women 
        from diverse communities, inspiring them to become more
        economically active and personally fulfilled. Our areas of 
        support include:personal development, education and 
        business support.

        <h2>
            Our Values
        </h2>
    <div class="paragraphb">
            From international advocacy to local projects, our core values guide everything we do. While we like to work flexibly, we have established a framework that aligns with our values.
            
            We are accessible
            We are here for all women – whatever their story – and we can appreciate the most complex of challenges. We celebrate diversity in every context, and are committed to helping women achieve their potential, no matter what their background or goals.
            
            We are creative
            We continually evaluate and improve our own practices to respond to women’s needs. Whether we are tackling complex issues or more common universal ones, we employ innovation and imagination. If there is no obvious existing solution, we work and think creatively to find a new one.
            
            We are leaders
            Pioneering new ideas, resources, programmes and connections makes us more effective. That’s why we are constantly pushing against the status quo and acting as a bold and forward-thinking voice that brings people together.
            
            We are change-makers
            We are absolutely committed to helping all women, and our focus is always on practical, positive outcomes. In other words, we get results. Whether we’re helping new businesses grow and thrive, inspiring improvements in legislation, or raising social awareness, our success lies in having a real and meaningful impact on individual women’s lives.
            
            We are collaborators
            We foster co-operation between individuals and organisations, from the grassroots to the highest level of government, bringing credibility, professionalism and enthusiasm to every partnership we undertake.
